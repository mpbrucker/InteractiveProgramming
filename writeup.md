# Mini-Project 4: Project Writeup/Reflection
##### Interactive 3D Graphics/World Generation
##### Adam Novotny, Matt Brucker

### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create an interactive 3D environment from scratch
. Over the course of this project, we implemented the basics of a 3D rendering engine in Python, by learning the matrix math required to convert 3D objects into points and space and points in space to points on the screen; used that to create a 3D environment that could be displayed; and added in the ability to move and look around within the environment. We also used a very simple random world generation to add some variety.
