#         'r team Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to create a 3D rendering engine to let a user walk around a procedurally generated landscape to explore different rendering and generation techniques.

Our mvp is to make a real-time rendering engine, and a basic landscape generation algorithm. After that, we will add different effects like bloom and shaders to the engine, and make the algorithm more interesting (for example, fractal trees),

Our learning goals:
Matt:
* Learn the math that is used in rendering engines

Adam:
* Learn how a 3D map is stored and rendered (both the math and the actual techniques)
* Learn the math behind

Libraries:
* Numpy
* Some library for displaying images @ 30fps
* A library for holding a the map?

Next check-in:
* Basic rendering engine
* Renders an image with some objects in 3D

Biggest Anticipated Risks:
* Performance - Solid 30fps in python???
* Unknown scope - But plenty of literature on the internet
